TO DO
-----------------
x Plug in Pokedex-Promise-v2 instead of using static JSON files that I saved manually
    - Used AngularJS's built in $cacheFactory instead

* Add checkbox filter to make the move list ONLY show "lost" moves
* Add checkboxes that make the list show only moves lost in a specific generation
* Find a more efficient way of finding out if a move is learnable in each version-group within the table
* Need option to make list show based on entire evolutionary line using pokeapi's "evolution-chain" call
* Filter list by gen pkmn was introduced in
* Display types?
